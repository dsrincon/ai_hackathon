Others, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are considering the possibility of legislation to shore up the health-insurance marketplaces created by the ACA—action that would involve working with Democrats.

Two companies there are developing the world’s first crewless ship, the WSJ’s Costas Paris reports, a vessel aimed at sailing on a modest route ferrying fertilizer that could mark a turning point in seaborne trade. With its limited route and small scale—the vessel dubbed the Yara Birkeland will cost $25 million and hold just 100 containers—appears to offer an ideal test for crewless ship operations. The electric-powered vessel will use Global Positioning System, radar, cameras and sensors to navigate 37 miles from a production site to port. The technology gets the attention, but the biggest test may be for the business case behind autonomous sailing.

That's why it's so popular. But if you're a visitor who is ready for a respite from skyscrapers, crowds and stimulation, there are plenty of other ways to spend your time.

As I wrote just a few weeks ago, the timing is right for Scripps to get bought -- and as far as Discovery and Scripps go, it'd be a match made in TV heaven. A merger would bring more shows targeted toward women under the same roof as Animal Planet, TLC and Discovery's namesake channel. And together they would surely be able to cut some overhead costs, as well as expand Scripps's content more quickly and cheaply to international markets where Discovery already has a platform.

But if you're hoping to save twice - deals plus sales tax-free shopping - think again: as of April 1, 2017, Amazon began collecting sales taxes from all states with a sales tax. That means that Prime Day 2017 won't be sales tax-free.The online retail giant had previously fought the imposition of sales tax on a state by state basis - from court battles to corporate exemptions . Today, Amazon collects sales tax in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (you can see the list here ). Amazon does not collect sales tax in Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon: A prior version of this story gave an incorrect address for the White House. The story has now been corrected.Getty Images Thanks, Mooch? A market that by now probably should be immune to D.C. chaos is taking in stride the news that White House communications director Anthony “Mooch” Scaramucci is out after just a few days.Paul Donovan, UBS’s global chief economist, says the latest reshuffling at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue “could be interpreted as the reasserting of authority over the executive branch, or a signal of the worst chaos the White House has known since President Jackson’s inauguration.” Then again, it is Apple reporting day, which comes against a backdrop of a pretty upbeat earnings season and a fairly ravenous appetite for those FAANG stocks. That’s not to say there’s not some fear that the run has been too hot for stocks , given August performances usually aren’t that great.

On contrary it is fragmented due to the presence of numerous local players that have a stronghold in regional pockets. Competition among them is moderate to high. In the near future, competition is slated to heat up in the global computer graphics market on account of keen players resorting to mergers and acquisitions to bolster their positions. Another factor likely to intensify competition is the low entry barriers for newcomers because of the easy availability and low cost of labor, particularly in Asia Pacific .

( IBM ) will report on Tuesday after the close. Analysts expect the company to earn $2.74 per share on $19.45 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter.IBM's a tough one, because even though its new business segments aren't growing fast enough to offset the decline in its legacy business, investors have to be thinking about risk-reward, Cramer reasoned. IBM stock is already down 10% over the past three months and its dividend yield is close to 4%.This looks like a situation that has $8 to $10 per share in downside and perhaps $15 in potential upside. That's not too bad, especially considering the dividend, he reasoned.Another company set to report is T-Mobile US Inc.  ( TMUS ) . "I like T-Mobile," he said, adding the he expects CEO John Legere to deliveAs hybrid investment vehicles, Health Savings Accounts, or HSAs, can be a bit of a windfall.

( DISCA ) and Viacom Inc. ( VIAB ) have begun conversations with Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. ( SNI ) , according to reports from The Wall Street Journal and Reuters . In both cases, talks are in early stages and a deal may not be sealed, the publications said, citing people familiar with the situation.Scripps shares spiked 14.6% in premarket trading Wednesday on the reports, while Discovery shares were up 7.6% and Viacom shares had added 0.5%. Shares in another of the smaller network owners, AMC Networks Inc. ( AMCX ) , were up 1.3%.Scripps and Viacom declined to comment on the reports, while Discovery did not immediately return a request for comment.Either transaction would make sense, for one overriding reason: TV network owners that don't also own a broadcast station or sports need size to sustain their positions on pay-TV platforms.Ironically, as pay-TV As Venezuela Spirals, U.S. Oil Confronts a $10 Billion Threat By Refineries are calibrated to handle the nation’s sludgy crude An embargo could spike gasoline prices, at least for a while Sen.

MAt the start of a vacation four years ago, I got off a plane and hopped into a car full of tears.While approaching the airport, my family learned that a 16-year-old friend had been diagnosed with blood cancer. Holy cow. But don’t jump to conclusions, I said. I follow the biotech sector closely, and the regular advances in cancer therapies are amazing. Things may well work out. That was just a wild guess. But it turned out to be right. Four years on, she is now in full remission and is a college student. Great news. Sadly, though, thanks to politicians, some other 16-year-old girl diagnosed with cancer over the next few years may not be so lucky. Why? Because the continuing ridiculous political spectacle, fueled by politicians on the left and right, has halted progress on policy. By my estimate, this has cost biopharma companies $21 billion in research funds in the past two years.

Photographer: Misha Friedman/Bloomberg Do you fret when your investment fund loses its star manager? If so, you’re not alone. When Bill Gross left PIMCO , many investors raced for the exits along with him . But next time, before you decide to switch funds, consider new evidence that underscores the idea that the underlying fund matters more than the individual trading securities.

The analysis of U.S. open-end actively managed equity and fixed income funds from January 2003 to December 2016, looking at gross excess returns and growth rates over one, three, six 12 and 36 months, shows a management change does not predict a performance dip.

The founder of Elliott Management Corp. contends that passive strategies, which buy a variety of securities to match the overall performance of an index, aren’t truly "investing" and that index fund providers don’t have incentive to push companies to change for the better and create shareholder value.Elliott, whose main hedge funds manage $33 billion, is best known for its high-profile activist and distressed wagers, including leading a group of holdout creditors seeking repayment for positions in Argentine debt.

That rapid surge hasn’t made them any more accepting. In fact, it may have done the opposite.

KPMG and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice think golf can help change that -- but can a sport which historically excluded women and minorities launch an upswing of gender diversity in the boardroom?

Raging bulls on Wall Street often argue that today's record-high stock market isn't as outrageously expensive as it was in early 2000. While that's generally true, at least one important measure of stock values is approaching those dot-com bubble-era levels. The S&P 500 is trading at 2.1 times its trailing revenue, according to FactSet. The last time it was higher? September 2000 when it was at 2.2 as the dot-com bubble was popping. Elevated valuation metrics like that give ammo to those who fear that the second-longest bull market in history has gotten a bit too hot. Wall Street pulled off a record-setting trifecta on Wednesday, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closing at record highs. CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index of market sentiment flipped to "extreme greed" mode this week.

The post-election rally on Wall Street, often referred to as the Trump rally, may not actually need the Trump agenda to survive. President Trump's promises of "massive" tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation did send U.S. stocks soaring to new heights following his November victory. But six months into his presidency, Trump has failed to enact that aggressive economic agenda. His administration has been mired in political scandals, Republican control of both chambers has devolved into infighting, and general gridlock persists in Washington. Despite the tumult and inactivity, the stock market keeps smashing records -- the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq each hit an all-time high this week. So why isn't Wall Street freaking out about Trump's troubles? Investors may have already dialed back their bets on Trump's ability to deliver sweeping tax reform or huge tax cuts, analysts say.

President Trump's effort to repeal and replace Obamacare came to a screeching halt Monday night after Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas vowed to vote against the latest draft of the health care bill. The dollar index -- which compares the greenback to its global peers -- declined to its lowest level since September. Investors are worried about the Trump administration's ability to follow through on its economic agenda. "Six months in office and with no major legislation signed into law, it seems that the 'The Art of the Deal' hasn't worked so far in U.S. politics," said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.

Takeover talk: Discovery Communications ( DISCA ) , which owns TLC and Animal Planet, is acquiring Scripps Networks ( SNI ) , which owns Food Network and HGTV, in an $11.9 billion deal. The deal has been in the works for several weeks. It's valued at $14.6 billion, or $90 per share, counting Discovery's assumption of Scripps' debt. Viacom also pursued Scripps but backed out of the bidding war last week. Meanwhile, Charter has shot down a plan for it to buy Sprint and create a media and telecom giant. The proposed merger would have resulted in a huge new company controlled by Sprint's ( S ) owner, the Japanese tech firm Softbank ( SFTBF ) , according to reports last week. But Charter ( CHTR ) dismissed the idea late Sunday. "We understand why a deal is attractive for SoftBank, but Charter has no interest in acquiring Sprint," the cable company said in a statement.

One investor has bet on a powerful resurgence in market turbulence—a wager that could net a profit of about $265 million if Wall Street’s fear gauge more than doubles in the next three months.An unknown investor made a massive trade via the options market Friday, as the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +1.82% the so-called fear gauge that tracks investor expectations for equity volatility, fell to its lowest since December 1993.About 1 million options contracts changed hands on a bet that the CBOE volatility gauge, called VIX, will rise to 25 by October.

For a long time, a big worry about dark pools, in the U.S., was that they were marketed as places for institutional investors to quietly trade large chunks of stock with each other away from the prying eyes of high-frequency traders, but they were actually full of high-frequency traders. That just turned out to be a feature of how stock trading works: Big institutions tend not to want to sell big chunks of stock at exactly the same millisecond that other big institutions want to buy similar-sized chunks of the same stocks, so high-frequency traders -- proprietary trading firms, or the trading desks of the banks that ran the dark pools -- serve a useful role in buying from the sellers and selling to the buyers. The purity of big institutions just buying and selling to each other, off in a quiet corner away from the public exchaDark trading has a bad reputation. Traders use venues called dark pools to buy and sell stocks without revealing beforehand the size of their orders or the price they are willing to accept. Not tipping their hand lets them trade without moving share prices against them, but hiding bids and offers reduces the flow of information that makes public stock exchanges efficient at setting prices. New European Union rules taking effect in January, known as MiFID II , are designed to force most equity trading back onto public, "lit" stock markets, but they may be insufficient to stop traders determined to remain in the dark.1. Who uses dark pools? Dark pools , though accounting for less than 10 percent of European equity trading, are central to how the biggest investors buy and sell shares. Large fund managers often own stakes of 5 percent or more in individual stocks. When they have to trade a lot of shares, they prefer to do the transaction on a dark venue as a block trade.

For years, Dell has been very consistent with XPS on the experience, design, commitment to quality and risk-taking on value-add features. Dell loaned me their latest XPS notebook, the XPS 13 2-in-1, and I used it as my primary device for a week and tertiary for a month. I’d like to share with you my experiences.

Ahead of Thursday's news the stock had rallied nicely from the early July lows. At Thursday's peak, shares had gained over 8% from the June/July bottom, its sharpest intra-month rise since the election. A consolidation may be ahead and with it low-risk entry opportunities for patient investors.During the post-election rally, Microsoft has been a very steady performer. Unlike Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) and Adobe Systems Incorporated ( ADBE ) , the stock is not a volatile mover even after very bullish news. Microsoft has shown a consistent pattern of brief consolidations and pullbacks without the sharp rips higher. Investors should expect this type of action to continue through year end.After regaining its footing near the June lows, Microsoft broke above a key overhead trendline on July 12.

The stock's charts don't look so hot, either.In this daily bar chart of FANG, we can see that the stock traded sideways for six months December through May. The stock's price seemed unable to make any upside progress during those months, although support continued to appear on dips under $100:However, Diamondback turned noticeably weaker in May, with a bounce stopping at $105 when previous upticks had pushed higher. Support below $100 also melted away.Similarly, the slope of the stock's 50-day moving-average (the yellow line in the chart above) got more negative in May. And in June, the 50-day line closed below the 200-day moving average (denoted in blue).

If so, here are some of Jim Cramer's top takeaways.Sometimes a stock comes down so hard and so fast, it takes your breath away, Cramer told viewers. That has certainly been the case with Alder BioPharmaceuticals ( ALDR ) , which has lost 45% of it's value over the past three months.Cramer said he's been dead wrong on this development-stage biotech, recommending it multiple times over the past few years. The company only has one drug in its near-term pipeline, a genetically engineered antibody treatment for migraines. Currently, there's only one treatment for migraines available and that's Allergan's ( AGN ) Botox.But when Alder reported the Phase III results on June 27, the stock got crushed, despite the trial meeting all of its goals. The problem? The results were widely expected and now investors are worried that rivals may beat the company to market.Cramer said while he's been wrong thus far on Alder, he only cares where a stock is going, not whereDigi International Inc.

The deal had been in motion, off and on, for five years. Finally, being willing to pay significantly more than rival suitor Viacom got the job done for Discovery, home of networks like ID, TLC and the mother-ship Discovery Channel. While Discovery’s stock shed more than 8% to close at $24.60 and Scripps gained 50 cents to close at $87.41—not exactly blockbuster movement—the deal had been priced in a while ago and both stocks had risen on the chances. Nevertheless, now that it finally has come to pass, the combination of two traditional TV programming powers (the Scripps lifestyle portfolio is headed by Food Network and HGTV) leaves behind a few questions in its wake. Here are some Discovery Communications Inc. ( DISCA )  announced it reached a deal to acquire Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  ( SNI )  in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $14.6 billion.

In 2007, business student David Steinberger and his partners pitched an idea for a tool to help comic fans and retailers manage their pre-orders.

They would only interfere with sales of paper copies. And besides, who wanted to read comics on a computer?Ten years later, comiXology not only launched a successful business, they created a new market channel that has expanded the audience for comics, graphic novels and manga worldwide, all without strangling the critical direct market of brick-and-mortar comic shops.

Scana Corp. dropped plans for two reactors Monday, leaving the two that Southern is building at the Vogtle plant in Georgia as the only ones under construction in the U.S. And even they are under threat: The utility had to take over management of the project from its bankrupt contractor Westinghouse Electric Co., and the plant is still years behind schedule and billions over budget. Now it must decide whether to finish them. Southern calling it quits could prove to be the final nail in the coffin for the long-awaited U.S. nuclear renaissance that has failed to materialize in the aftermath of Japan’s Fukushima nuclear accident. In 2012, Southern and Scana became the first companies to gain approval to build U.S. reactors in more tFauquier Bankshares, Inc.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb laid out plans to have drugmakers conduct doctor education programs on immediate-release opioids, which account for 90 percent of the 200 million opioid painkiller prescriptions written in the U.S. each year. The agency is also exploring whether pain-management training should be required for doctors as well as nurses, pharmacists or other health-care providers. “America is simply awash in immediate-release opioid products,” Gottlieb said at a speech in Silver Spring, Maryland, as part of a two-day public FDA mFederal Reserve Could Use a Little Help From Investors The Federal Reserve has plans to pull back its stimulus. The economy isn't cooperating. Jul 27, 2017 By Nir Kaissar (Bloomberg Gadfly) --Attention investors: The Federal Reserve needs you. The Fed is in a pickle. It badly wants to pull back the huge stimulus it put in place in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The fed funds rate has never been this low for this long. The monthly fed funds rate -- an average of daily rates -- was less than 1 percent for 104 consecutive months from October 2008 to May of this year. Before then, it had been that low just seven times since July 1954, the longest period for which rates are available. The fed funds rate averaged 1 percent in June. The Fed’s balance sheet, too, had never been bigger than $1 trillion before the financial crisis. It’s now $4.5 trillion. The problem is that the economy isn’t cooperating. For one thing, inflation is running below the Fed’s target. In its June statement, FedEx Will Shun Most Home Holiday Fees, Unlike UPS By Package-delivery giants plan differing approaches to pricing Jump in online shopping fuels shipment of more oversized goods FedEx Corp. will forgo most holiday surcharges on home deliveries this year, drawing a contrast with plans for stepped-up fees at United Parcel Service Inc. amid a surge in online shopping. Additional holiday charges will only be applied to packages that are big or bulky enough to require special handling, FedEx said in a statement Thursday. UPS’s extra levies will bump up the cost of residential deliveries by about 3 percent. The divergent fee structures represent sharply different approaches at the couriers, which have been contending with a rush of home deliveries as e-commerce continues to expand. FedEx may be able to woo small businesses or individual shippers away from UPS, where they’d have to pay the extra fee, said Kevin Sterling, a Seaport Global Holdings analyst. “FedEx is smaller on the ground side Fenimore Asset Management Increased Nbt Bancorp (NBTB) Position; Trimble (TRMB) Shorts Down By 10.02% July 26, 2017 - By Stephen Andrade Fenimore Asset Management Inc increased Nbt Bancorp Inc (NBTB) stake by 61.87% reported in 2016Q4 SEC filing.

The final five-year plan under Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne, who’s set to retire in 2021, will target boosting annual deliveries beyond a self-imposed limit of 10,000 cars, which allows the company to operate with less-stringent fuel-economy rules, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Under the plan, which is likely to be unveiled in early 2018 and could expose the carmaker to stricter environmental regulations, Ferrari will also build more hybrid models to improve its vehicles’ efficienfewer startups . 3.

It was just last month that Ulta closed at an all-time high of $313.73 a share, but it didn't stay up there for long. The stock tumbled 18 percent in the short time since then, erasing nearly all of its gains for the year. Investors could have avoided this roller-coaster ride. Ulta may be one of the fastest-growing publicly traded retailers in America, but it's still a retailer.

The risks are high, as the price-to-earnings multiple of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.73% ( about 25, depending on the indicator ) is far greater than its historical norm (14.5).

But, still, people are apathetic.In fact, my experience over the past 20 years and through each of the past two major asset bubbles (the internet bubble in 2000 and the credit crisis in 2008-2009), is that the unanimous identification of an asset bubble did not take place until after the asset bubble had burst.

Economists don't expect the central bank to make a change to interest rates -- leaving the federal funds rate at 1% to 1.25% -- though investors will comb through the Fed statement to discern when the central bank could begin to unwind its balance sheet.

By @felixgillette More stories by Felix Gillette In the menagerie of television talking heads who have come to prominence advocating for Donald Trump, Boris Epshteyn is hardly the most memorable. He lacks Sean Spicer’s flair for the absurd, Kellyanne Conway’s gift at turning a phrase (“alternative facts”), Corey Lewandowski’s smoldering menace, Jeffrey Lord’s Zen inertia, or Sebastian Gorka’s staunch facial hair.

( JBHT ) has taken over the #411 spot from Garmin Ltd ( GRMN ), according to The Online Investor . Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons.

But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true "apples-to-apples" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. ( JBHT ), the market cap is now $10.15 billion, versus Garmin Ltd ( GRMN ) atIn what should come as a surprise to absolutely no one, Sears Holdings Corp.

It said regulators would keep a watch out for gray rhinos. A term coined by Michele Wucker, an American policy wonk, it refers to a “highly probable, high impact yet neglected threat: kin to both elephant in the room and the improbable and unforeseeable black swan.”While black-swan events—a concept popularized by statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a 2007 best-seller—are by definition almost impossible to predict, gray rhinos are events everyone sees coming, but fail to do anything about. Wucker wrote a 2016 book, “The Gray Rhino: How to Recognize and Act on the Obvious Dangers We Ignore.”In this case, the known but overlooked threat has been a disconcerting buildup of debt in China’s banks and firms via its shadow banking syInvestors haven’t soured on all active fund managers -- only those who pick U.S. stocks.Actively managed mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that own domestic stocks experienced $98.5 billion in net redemptions in the first six months of 2017, according to the latest figures compiled by Morningstar Inc. Active funds that buy international stocks attracted inflows of $8.7 billion and active funds that buy bonds gathered $106.5 billion.“The trend for U.S. stocks funds keeps going and going,” said Russel Kinnel, director of manager research at Morningstar. “There is a perception that they can’t beat their benchmarks, especially when it comes to large-cap stocks.”Passive mutual funds and ETFs remain popular across the board. Those funds had inflows of $394.1 billion in the first six months of the year, while active funds as a group saw net redemptions of $6.8 billion. The trend has benefited the two biggest money managers, BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group, both of which are best known Investors know this story.

The cheap-chic discounter broke its losing streak today, forecasting a sales increase for the first time in five quarters, and pushing its shares up by as much as 4.4%. The news comes on the heels of J.C. Penney’s brightened second quarter forecast , as the nation’s 8th and 37th biggest retailers, respectively, delivered some sunny news amid the massive store closings, bankruptcies and liquidations shaking up the sector. Target is now expecting to post a “modest” increase in its second quarter comparable sales, crediting improved traffic and sales trends through the first two months of the quarter for the boost. The retailer is banking on lowered prices to compete better with rival Wal-Mart, turning its stores into local fulfillment centers for online orders to fight Amazon , and the rollout of 12 exclusive home and apparel brands to fuel a sustained revival at the chain.

If Wall Street is concerned about all the drama in D.C., it's definitely not showing it. The stock market keeps rewriting the record book despite the political scandals and legislative gridlock in Washington. The Dow did it again on Friday, climbing 85 points to notch its third straight record close, the 25th this the year. The index has now celebrated 42 all-time highs since President Trump's election last November, according to LPL Financial. It's up about 3,300 points over that span. Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 also zoomed to a record on Friday, its first since June 19. The broad index has now closed in record territory 25 times this year and 33 times since Trump's victory. The Nasdaq took a beating earlier this summer, but it's bounced back nicely since then. The tech index is now less than 0.5% away from its first record since early June.

( DISCA ) is going to take it.After weeks of takeover speculation, Discovery said Monday, July 31, it has reached agreement with Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. ( SNI ) to buy the owner of HGTV, DIY Network and Food Network for $90 a share. The cash-and-stock deal is valued at $14.6 billion including $2.7 billion in assumed debt. The companies anticipated they would close the transaction early next year.For owners of Scripps Networks, the deal is a windfall. The takeout price -- $63 in cash and $27 in Class C Discovery stock -- is 34% higher than where shares of the cable network company closed on July 18, just before news of the talks sent the stock soaring. By agreeing to be acquired, Scripps CEO Ken Lowe secures a deal that caps more than 30 years at the once modest TV station and newspaper company that grew a set of cable networks that was spun out in 2007.Those networks, led by HGTV and Food Channel provide marketers with a direct coIt's important to know when to be skeptical and when to believe, Jim Cramer told his Mad Money viewers Tuesday. Too often, when a top-notch CEO stumbles, investors head for the exits. But that's exactly when they should be buying.Both Caterpillar ( CAT ) and McDonalds ( MCD ) come to mind. Cramer said that Cat delivered its first great quarter in years, and even with shares up 5.8% today, he's still a believer and a buyer. Same with McDonalds, where CEO Steve Easterbrook has been doubted ever since he took over, but has continued to deliver quarter after quarter.Cramer said it's hard to fathom that a penny-a-share earnings miss at 3M ( MMM ) translated to at $10 decline in the company's stock. 3M is a total buy. Domino's Pizza ( DPZ ) also delivered strong results and said that the issues it faced, primarily in Europe, are fixable. So why would investors sell shares down 10% in a single day?

And just like Jeff Bezos, who ceded profit to win share and trounce rivals, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink has seen expenses rise.Revenue, while up, missed analysts’ estimates. BlackRock’s second-quarter costs increased in almost every category including employee compensation and distribution and servicing costs.Asset managers are facing pressure as money flows out of more expensive active funds into lower fee passive products, where prices are headed to zero.

The equivalent of one 700ml bottle of Hibiki for 11,760 yen, 240 yen cheaper than the listed price of 12,000 yen--and less than half the price of what a full bottle trades for on Amazon Japan.There was a time when not many people knew just how good Japanese whiskey really was---in those days before Suntory's Hibiki (響) was featured in the film  Lost In Translation.  "For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time," Bill Murray suavely purred into the camera, dressed a tux, and a legend was born.  Of course, one of the delights of the film, if you understood Japanese, was the hilarious dialogue between the Japanese cast in the scene where the commercial is being filmed which was not subtitled for the American audience but you can read here .Lost In Translation,  in the end, made Hibiki "lost in the supermarket." Finding a bottle of HIBIKI® 17 YEARS OLD  (Hibiki 17) in Tokyo now is about as easy as finding a seat on the subway during rush hour.Jamba, Inc.

In the pursuit of “more,” leaders frequently chase business goals and outcomes with immense passion and zeal, often at a significant cost to themselves and others. Generally, leaders are able to temper these pursuits of future goals and outcomes with perspective: how much time, effort, and cost they should spend to attain their desired goals and outcomes.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In trading on Friday, shares of Meta Financial Group Inc ( CASH ) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 16.7, after changing hands as low as $65.10 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 58.8. A bullish investor could look at CASH's 16.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Lenovo ThinkPad notebooks have an impressive legacy stretching back to the 90s, and have long been known for their durability and price-performance. I am always interested to see how Lenovo manages to bridge the gap between the old and new, so I jumped at the opportunity to spend some time with the newest generation of these two notebooks. After using the new Carbon as my primary device for a week, I’d like to offer my preliminary review. I’ll follow up with the Yoga in a few days. What I Liked     The 14-inch display was overall a good size and very thin. I appreciated the narrow bezel, which seems to be the way the notebook industry is heading and limits what I consider wasted space. I thought the 1,920 x 1,080 resolution worked well for video streaming Netflix and YouTube—detailed and colorful—but was a little light for photos. Given this is Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Lenovo recently loaned me two devices for review—the ThinkPad X1 Yoga and the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. While the X1 Carbon is more of a traditional corporate notebook and I reviewed here , the X1 Yoga is a 2-in-1 convertible—it comes with a touch screen that folds 360 degrees around into a tablet. After using the X1 Yoga as my primary device for one week, and secondary device for two weeks, I wanted to offer up my thoughts on the device. I actually wrote a review of the prior generation of the Yoga last year (which you can read here ), so I was interested to see if and how Lenovo addressed analyst and customer feedback. I am pleased to say they did. What I liked   Starting with first impressions, I like that this device is offered not only in plain black, but also silver. The black is classic Lenovo and looks sleeker than the silver in my opinion—however, it can also be a fingerprint magnet. Choice is good —Lenovo is giving consumers the option to give their device tLeon Lazaroff Jul27,20178:57AMEDT Viacom Inc. ( VIAB ) won't attempt to acquire Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.

On March 19, 2017, Array BioPharma announced it had withdrawn its New Drug Application for binimetinib monotherapy for the treatment of NRAS -mutant melanoma.

But a couple of weeks ago, a missive from the institution landed in my inbox and caught my eye.“Venmo Us!” the subject line read, with instructions for how to send the organization a donation through the mobile payments app. (It’s a private school.) I typically reserve Venmo, which allows friends to easily transfer money to one another, for things like paying for drinks or a restaurant bill. So I felt a little bit uncomfortable with the idea of my high school lurking in this seemingly peers-only space.But after giving it some thought, I’m rethinking that initial response. Changes in the way people donate money, suggest that a tool like Venmo could be key to fueling charitable gifts in the future. Philanthropy overall increased just 1% between 2015 and 2016, according to the Blackbaud Institute , an organization that researches trends in charitable giving.

Insiders at these traditional retailers, however, beg to differ. At a time when insider buying is light in this full-priced stock market, I’ve noticed millions of dollars worth of buying by executives at over a half-dozen traditional retailers during the past several weeks.

Yet with the $35,000 price tag just a starting point, many mainstream buyers will still find the electric sedan out of reach. Tesla has characterized the Model 3 as its inroad to mass-market drivers -- the base model, before options or incentives, will be roughly half the price of the company’s cheapest Model S. A crucial unanswered question is whether would-be buyers will be able to add features that have been popular on the brand’s existing high-end models, without being priced out of the market for the car. “One question for Model 3 reservation holders is: How much are they really willing to pay?” said David Whiston, an auto analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. “Thirty-five grand is goingMUST WATCH Running 1,000 miles in 33 days for kids 05:14 Whether you're a total beginner intimidated to take those first steps or you've recently taken a wrong turn straight into a running rut , we're here to help you get moving in the right direction.

A classic panhandle, the ultra-narrow strip separates Botswana and Angola as it runs 280 miles (450 km) west to east from the main part of Namibia to the Zambezi River on the eastern border. For much of its length, the Caprivi is only 20 miles (32 kilometers) wide -- a narrow extenuation of national sovereignty matched only by the equally obscure Wakhan Corridor in northern Afghanistan. There's a good argument to be made that the Caprivi has played a key role in modern pop history: Both Freddie Mercury and a band called Queen may never have existed without the strip's creation. More on that later. As a tourist destination, the Caprivi has only recently come into its own. It was off limits to safari seekers and other National Beverage Corp.

These drug combos appear to significantly improve lung function and may generate billions in annual sales.Vertex shares jumped 20 percent on the news. Its once-shaky long-term sales outlook suddenly looks much steadier. And a few quirks of its CF drug franchise make it an especially appealing acquisition target -- even at a now nearly $40 billion market cap.Humanity benefits when diseases get cured.

International benchmark Brent crude futures broke through the $50/barrel mark in Tuesday's trading and U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures followed suit and are quoted at $48.35/barrel in recent trading.  Oil prices are subject to constantly shifting paradigms, but this week's bullish move has been driven by a much-larger-than expected-decline in U.S. crude inventories based on Tuesday's weekly data from the American Petroleum Institute (the more widely-followed EIA data will be released this morning.)  Also, Saudi Arabia announced Monday that the country would limit crude exports to 6.6 million barrels/day, reducing those shipments by almost 1 million barrels a day from last year's level.The most obvious way to play a rise in crude prices is with Permian superstars Diamondback Energy and RSP Permian, two names I have mentioned in prior Forbes columns.

He visited their offices in winter to check if they could afford heating. In the early years of market capitalism in Russia it was almost impossible to find reliable information about companies from earnings reports, so those investors prepared to travel to run-down Siberian cities in sub-zero temperatures had an immediate advantage. The proof is in the 2,098 percent return Stockholm-based East Capital’s first Russia-focused stock fund made in the first decade of the millennium, about a third more than the average of peer funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.

The amount of opioid painkillers prescribed in the U.S. peaked in 2010 and declined each year through 2015, according to an analysis released by the Centers for Disease Control on Thursday. Despite that drop, opioids are prescribed about three times as much as they were in 1999, with use varying widely depending on geographic area, the agency said. “With opioid medication, we’re still seeing too many get too much for too long,” said acting CDC Director Anne Schuchat on Thursday on a call with reporters.

Whether as “water” in PepsiCo Inc.’s Naked drink range, as “milk” in Starbucks Corp.’s coffees, as shampoo in L’Oreal SA’s products or even as a patty in Beyond Meat’s vegan burgers, the tropical fruit has captured new markets with a growing reputation as a healthy, natural product. The popularity has been a boon for prices, with the cost of coconut oil alone more than doubling since its low in 2013. But it hasn’t translated into increased production as diseases, natural disasters and ageing plantations kept global output stagnant over the past decade.

By @joshuabrustein More stories by Joshua Brustein Sixteen teams of robotics researchers are traveling to Japan this week to help Amazon.com Inc. solve its warehouse problem. The company has a fleet of robots that drive around its facilities gathering items for orders. But it needs humans for the last step — picking up items of various shapes, then packing the right ones into the correct boxes for shipping. It ’ s a classic example of an activity that ’ s simple, almost mindless, for humans, but still unattainable for robots.

This hurt the greenback by casting doubts on other reforms promised by President Donald Trump — including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Big picture, the GOP’s Obamacare setback is really only part of the problem for the dollar. Even if politicians miraculously get their act together (don't hold your breath) the dollar is still in for trouble. In fact, it's been weak all year for reasons that have little to do with Washington, D.C. — and those issues aren't going away soon.

Fidelity boasted in a press release on Monday that “100% of Fidelity's stock and bond index mutual funds and sector ETFs will have total net expenses lower than their comparable Vanguard fund.” Even Lower Fidelity is attempting to take the low-cost mantle from Vanguard Sources: Fidelity, Vanguard The move prodded Vanguard into a turn of its own. Vanguard has rightly argued for four decades that, “The less you pay for your funds, the more you keep in your pocket -- it’s that simple.” In response to Fidelity’s announcement, however, Vanguard spokesman John Woerth acknowledged that there’s more to consider than just fees, such as “how closely the fund tracks its index and after-tax returns.” Unfair Flows Fidelity has struggled to keep up with VanShare Aug 3, 2017 2:29 PM EDT Shire PLC's ADHD business has been at its core for years and helped it afford last year's transformative, $35 billion dollar purchase of Baxalta Inc. As thanks, Shire on Thursday announced, along with its second-quarter results, that it will decide whether to spin off or sell its ADHD business by the end of this year. The firm thinks it has two very different businesses, which "could be better off managed separately," according to CEO Flemming Ornskov on the firm's earnings call. Bankers might be excited for what would be the biggest health-care spinoff since, ironically, Baxalta. But there isn't an airtight case for such a deal.

By Patrick (left) and John. Photographer: Balazs Gardi for Bloomberg Businessweek Every day, Americans spend about $1.2 billion online. That figure has roughly doubled in the past five years, according to the Department of Commerce, and it’s likely to double again in the next five as the internet continues to devour traditional retail. So it might come as a surprise that the web’s financial infrastructure is old and slow. For years, the explosive growth of e-commerce has outpaced the underlying technology; companies wanting to set up shop have had to go to a bank, a payment processor, and “gateways” that handle connections between the two.

Wall Street was expecting Apple to deliver earnings per share of $1.57 on revenue of $44.89 billion. Sell-side analysts were mostly enthusiastic about Apple's latest quarter. “We believe the iPhone installed base will exceed 635M exiting C2017, and this impressive installed base should drive strong iPhone replacement sales and earnings, as well as cash flow generation to fund strong long-term capital returns,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley as Benzinga reported Wednesday.

John Wainwright, an Australian software engineer based in Sunnyvale, Calif., did just that. On April 3, 1995, he became Amazon’s AMZN, -0.87% first non-company customer when he purchased “Fluid Concepts And Creative Analogies: Computer Models Of The Fundamental Mechanisms Of Thought” by Douglas Hofstadter. (It’s still available on Amazon for $33.55 hardcover or $7.80 paperback.) It was not the easiest of orders for Amazon, especially for the company’s very first book sale. “That purchase is still part of my Amazon history,” Wainwright says. MarketWatch spoke with Wainwright about being No. 1 and how he nearly ended up working for Amazon — before the company’s 1997 initial public offering on May 15, 1997. MarketWatch: That was quite a book. Chapter 1 is entitled “To Seek Whence Cometh a Sequence.” It doesn’t look like your average bedtime reading.

Still, Bitcoin Cash’s value is around $7.7 billion, placing it third among all prominent cryptocurrencies, behind Ethereum’s Ether token, with a value of $21 billion, but ahead of digital currency Ripple at $6.7 billion.Market participants said a lack of wide acceptance by other players, notably exchanges, in the digital currency industry, was resulting in few, if any, trades in Bitcoin Cash. That early illiquidity had supported its earlier rise, but a lack of selling also means its downside is limited, according to Elizabeth Stark an entrepreneur and founder of Lightning NetworkThe Most Popular Startup Nation In The World Is Now Shifting Its Focus To AI {{article.article.images.featured.caption}} Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.

Shares of the meal-kit delivery company sank as low as $6.51, a 35 percent drop since its initial public offering. Amazon Technologies Inc., an Amazon subsidiary, filed a July 6 trademark application for “prepared food kits composed of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or vegetables . . . ready for cooking and assembly as a meal.” Blue Apron delivers boxes of pre-portioned ingredients and instructions to cook meals at home.

While Trump has suggested Amazon is a monopoly, an antitrust case would likely spark criticism of payback for The Washington Post’s reporting PUBLISHED : Thursday, 27 July, 2017, 2:40pm UPDATED : Thursday, 27 July, 2017, 2:41pm 18 May 2017 By Leon Lazaroff In 1998, the U.S. government sued Microsoft Corporation alleging that the software maker had become a monopoly, bundling its Internet Explorer web browser with an operating system that had become the industry standard on Intel-powered computers. Nearly 20 years later, President Trump has all but said the same about another Seattle-area based company, Amazon Inc. In a series of tweets, Trump has called Amazon a monopoly, suggesting with typical subtlety that the online retailer be investigated for anti-competitive practices at odds with the Sherman Antitrust Act. Yet unlike the government’s case against Microsoft, Trump’s recent attacks against Amazon are sThe technology sector, the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, has been getting taken to task in recent weeks. For example, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index is lower by 4.1 percent over the past month while the largest dedicated technology exchange traded fund (ETF) is also lower by 4.1 percent over the same period. That means investors are repudiating stocks such as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.57% Microsoft Corporation MSFT, +0.53% Facebook Inc. FB, +0.33% and others. What is bad for those stocks and other tech titans can be good news for select ETFs, namely the Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (nysearca:TECS). Like any leveraged ETF, TECS is best deployed as a short-term trade, not a long-term investment, but the bearish technology ETF does highlight the recent headwinds encountered by the sector with a gain of almost 11 percent over the past month.

The Trump market: President Trump finishes his first six months in office on Thursday, and stock markets like what they see. The Nasdaq closed at a record high on Wednesday to cap a nine-day winning streak. The S&P 500 also hit a new high. The S&P 500 and Dow have gained roughly 9% since Trump took office, while the Nasdaq is up almost 15%. The momentum could continue on Thursday. U.S. stock futures were pointing to another day of gains. Still, there are doubts about Trump's economic agenda. Six months in, there has been little progress made on health care and tax reform. 2.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross opened high-level economic talks on July 19 by scolding China over its trade surplus. That doesn’t necessarily signal a trade war is imminent -- the two countries have come through other rocky patches since Donald Trump became U.S. president. Still, Trump is weighing whether to restrict imports of Chinese steel and aluminum, a move that could prompt retaliation from President Xi Jinping. Such tit-for-tat actions could lead to a Chinese backlash against American businesses. The following are among those most at risk: 1.

While the U.S. doesn’t place last on any specific measure, it is among the weakest on all of them, resulting in an average that pushes it down to the bottom of the heap.While elevated valuations don’t necessarily mean that a selloff is imminent, let alone a recession, academic research “has shown that undervalued equity markets have achieved higher future returns in the long run than their overvalued counterparts, which holds for different valuation measures alike,” Norbert Keimling, head of StarCapital Research, wrote in a report.Read: Why long-term U.S. stock returns look dismalOn the other end of the scale,These Are The Sectors That Might Be Able To Survive Amazon By Travel, autos, finance seen safest as e-commerce giant expands Regulation and unique products create larger hurdles The Takeaways From Amazon's Second-Quarter Earnings Almost nothing seems out of reach for Amazon.com Inc. these days.

For instance, although I share the policy views of sections 253 and 257, those provisions purport to displace the President’s exclusive constitutional authority to recognize foreign governments, including their territorial bounds, in conflict with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Zivotofsky v. Kerry.Additionally, section 216 seeks to grant the Congress the ability to change the law outside the constitutionally required process. The bill prescribes a review period that precludes the President from taking certaThis Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon for $3.19 follow us! Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

As we head into the rest of the year, here are my three predictions for the second half:The FAANGs Lose Their BiteThe FAANG stocks -- Facebook ( FB ) , Amazon ( AMZN ) , Apple ( AAPL ) , Netflix ( NFLX ) and Alphabet/Google ( GOOG ) , ( GOOGL ) -- were the major story in 2017's first half. In fact, much of the Nasdaq's earlier in 2017 stemmed from just these hot stocks.However, the FAANGs' advance has modulated since Alphabet and Amazon both hit the magical milestone of $1,000 a share recently -- and to me, most if not all of these names' 2017 gains seem to already be baked in. So, I think the FAANGs will underperform during 2017's second half.You Can Bank on FinancialsThe financials have started to act better over the past month, and I lTHL Credit Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") ( NYSE: TSLF) today announced the declaration of its monthly distribution of $0.105 per common share, payable July 31, 2017.

But with so many coastal choices, it can be a challenge to pick the perfect stretch of sand. Seasonal weather definitely has a bearing on destination decisions. The best bet for sunshine on the west coast (Andaman Sea) is November to April; while on the east coast (Gulf of Thailand), it's January to September. Veteran Thai travelers always check ahead before heading to lesser-visited destinations -- many hotels, resorts and restaurants in non-A-list places close for the low season. Choosing a full-service beachside base camp to begin a journey is a smart approach. You can strike out from any number of such bases by using the network of ferries that connect Thailand's islands.

The plan, Gottlieb said, is to stem the tide of addiction to the pills by limiting the number of people exposed to them in the first place. “Most people who become addicted to opioids are medically addicted,” Gottlieb said in a wide-ranging interview with Bloomberg in New York. “The way to reduce the TrustCo Bank NY (TRST) Reaches $7.89 After 9.00% Up Move, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Co (HMHC) Has 1.12 Sentiment July 24, 2017 - By Winifred Garcia The stock of TrustCo Bank Corp NY (NASDAQ:TRST) is a huge mover today!

The ride-hailing service has agreed to cede its operations to a rival in Russia and neighboring countries. Uber is creating a yet-to-be-named service with Yandex ( YNDX ) , which is winning the battle with Uber on its home turf. Uber will invest $225 million and contribute its UberEats service to the joint venture. Yandex will invest $100 million. But Yandex will own 59%, while Uber will own 37% and employees will hold the rest. And the CEO of Yandex, Tigran Khudaverdyan, will be in charge of the combined business. Related: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigns. Now what? Yandex is the largest ride-hailing service in Russia, although it gets most of its revenue from its search, portal and e-commerce business. The ride service had been profitable until last year, when it cut its minimum fares.

He visited their offices in winter to check if they could afford heating. In the early years of market capitalism in Russia it was almost impossible to find reliable information about companies from earnings reports, so those investors prepared to travel to run-down Siberian cities in sub-zero temperatures had an immediate advantage. The proof is in the 2,098 percent return Stockholm-based East Capital’s first Russia-focused stock fund made in the first decade of the millennium, about a third more than the average of peer funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The anecdote may seem redundant in an age where information can be obtained at the click of a mouse and money managers are Viacom Inc. beat revenue and profit forecasts in its latest quarter, but saw a decline in domestic advertising revenue.

Whether as “water” in PepsiCo Inc.’s Naked drink range, as “milk” in Starbucks Corp.’s coffees, as shampoo in L’Oreal SA’s products or even as a patty in Beyond Meat’s vegan burgers, the tropical fruit has captured new markets with a growing reputation as a healthy, natural product. The popularity has been a boon for prices, with the cost of coconut oil alone more than doubling since its low in 2013. But it hasn’t translated into increased production as diseases, natural disasters and aging plantations kept global output stagnant over the past decade. That’s about to change thanks to a program of replantings and rehabilitation across the tropics. Output of copra, the dried coconut meat that’s used to make coconut oil, will jump more than 30 percent in the decade to 2026 as yields in the biggest growers rebound, according to a JWaverton Investment Management LTD Cut By $5.29 Million Its Old Dominion Freight Line Com Us$0.10 (ODFL) Position; BNP PARIBAS SPONS AD (BNPQY) Sellers Decreased By 76.01% Their Shorts July 14, 2017 - By Michael Collier Waverton Investment Management Ltd decreased Old Dominion Freight Line Inc Com Us$0.10 (ODFL) stake by 35.87% reported in 2016Q4 SEC filing.

It isn’t the chaos in Washington or rising worker pay. It’s what Amazon.com Inc. is, or could be, doing to their business models. The expanding online behemoth has morphed from a retail category killer to a much broader enterprise that now competes with everything from high-end grocers to technology developers.

Looking at the last 90 days of earnings calls and other corporate events such as investor days, a trend emerges. Amazon comes up a lot. It was mentioned a staggering 635 times over that time frame, while President Trump came up just 162 times and wages were discussed 111, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

And no—they’re not sailing with young children. For that matter, they’re not sailing with children at all. Their obsession started in 2000, when a customer told them about the cruise line. They had already taken the kids to Walt Disney World and thought it would be a fun family vacation—their kids were 13 and 14 at the time. But John wasn’t so sure. As Joanne recalls, “He took his pointer finger and shook it at me and went, ‘If I don’t have a good time, this is all your fault.’” Much to John’s surprise, they got hooked, sometimes taking their kids along for the ride, but sometimes not. Now they often leave their kids in charge of the kielbasa shop and book back-to-back sailings, staying on a Disney ship for 20 days or more. “We don’Why baseball can't have a 'field of dreams' approach by Abigail Brooks @_abigailbrooks Baltimore Orioles Executive Vice President John Angelos sits down with CNNMoney's Ahiza Garcia to talk diversity in baseball and efforts to grow America's pastime.
