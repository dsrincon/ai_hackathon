Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported , citing sources, that Discovery DISCA, -0.04% was in talks to combine with Scripps SNI, -0.71% , but that terms were not made available. Scripps has a market valuation of about $10.2 billion, according to FactSet, while Discovery’s value sits around $10 billion. Analysts at Evercore, led by Vijay Jayant, said following the positive impact the report had on both of the stocks, there were questions about the industry logic.

WBA, +0.58% said Tuesday it is bringing nearly 500 jobs to Chandler, Ariz., as it relocates its Tempe pharmacy operations support center. The company will keep that Phoenix-area facility open as a pharmacy mail services support facility to support expected future growth, it said in a statement. The drugstore chain said 191 of the new jobs will meet or exceed the Maricopa County median wage for 2017. The company is moving 300 current positions from the Tempe facility to the new center, which will be 60,000 square feet. Jobs include pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and call center agents. Walgreens stock was up 0.7% Tuesday but has fallen 3% in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% has gained 10%.
